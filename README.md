Final proyect for our Computer Graphics university's class.

The proyect is a tower defense game called AntDefender made in c++ using DirectX11.

In the game you play as an Ant that is trying to defend its anthole from being destroyed by other animals or insects.
You can collect leafs that spawn randomly through out the map, this leafs are usefull for two things:
1-Make insects that help you protect your anthole or collect even more leafs
2-Survive the winter

The game ends when winter comes (about 3 minutes) then if you collected enough leafs to survive the winter you win!
The amount of leafs needed to survive depends on how many other insects you made are alive at the end of your playthrough.

It was made through out 6 months.
That's about it, we hope you have fun playing it!
