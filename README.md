Final assignment for our Computer Graphics university class.

The project is called AntDefender, a tower defense game written in C++ with DirectX11.

In the game, you take on the role of an ant, seeking to protect its anthole from other insects or animals.
On the map, leaves will occasionally spawn and you can gather them. There are two uses for these leaves:
1. Grow insects to assist you in your defense or gather additional leaves.
2. Get through the winter.

In roughly three minutes, the game ends with the arrival of winter. If you gather enough leaves to make it through the season, you win!
Depending on how many other insects you managed to keep alive at the end of your playthrough, you will require different amounts of leaves to pass the winter.

It was made over 6 months.
That's about it; we hope you have fun playing it!
